# Weather epaper display

This repo contains an experiment to drive epaper display, connected to an esp32s2 chip.
we use the micropython firmware on the chip, with additional microython libraries for mqtt, and epaper spi control

## Expected Outcomes

- Evaluating the ease of multi device control implementation, and microython maturity
- Evaluating the deployment options to lean the install of devices

- Evaluating semantic and protocol over mqtt to control displays
- Evaluating the ease of creating new screens and design toolchain
